## WARNING!! vvv
This project is not finished as this is just for me to warm up to C language and get more comfrontable of using GitHub. 

The basic funtions are in the code itself. I had fun with this project as I get work on data types and passing values. Anyhow, enjoy the code of what left of it. :)

$ gcc random_project.c -o  random_project
$ ./random_project
