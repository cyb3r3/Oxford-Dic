# WARNING!! vvv
This project is not finished as this is just for me to warm up to C language and get more comfrontable of using GitHub. 
The basic funtions are in the code itself. I had fun with this project as I get work on data types and passing values. Anyhow, enjoy the code of what left of it. :)

## Setup 
To get the code running, you will need to download 2 of the files. The text file and C file.

Afterwards, run this in your terminal. 
# $ gcc random_project.c -o  random_project
# $ ./random_project
